# Tasks: AI-Powered Todo Chatbot (Phase III)

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-ai-chatbot/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL - not requested in feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- Paths shown below use monorepo structure from Phase II

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed) or sequentially in priority order
  - US1 (P1) → US2 (P1) → US3 (P2) → US4 (P3) → US5 (P3)
- **Frontend (Phase 8)**: Can start after Foundational phase, benefits from at least one user story being complete for testing
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but easier to test with tasks from US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1/US2 for testing but independent
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1 for creating test tasks
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1-US4 for realistic stats

### Within Each User Story

- All MCP tools are implemented in Foundational phase
- Each story primarily involves:
  1. Verify tool works for that story's use case
  2. Update agent system prompt for new intents
  3. Test agent behavior end-to-end
  4. Verify response formatting

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup Phase**:
- T002, T003, T005 can run in parallel with T001, T004

**Foundational Phase**:
- T007 can run parallel with T006 (different models)
- T016-T019 can run in parallel (different MCP tools, same file - but independent functions)
- After T022: All user story phases can start in parallel if team capacity allows

**User Story Phases**:
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Within a story: Most tasks are sequential (verification → prompt update → testing)

**Frontend Phase**:
- T073, T074, T075 can run in parallel (different components)
- T076-T083 depend on components being created

**Polish Phase**:
- T084, T085, T086, T087 can all run in parallel (different files/concerns)

---

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase MCP Tools

```bash
# After T013-T014 complete, launch tool implementations in parallel:
Task T015: add_task tool
Task T016: get_tasks tool (parallel)
Task T017: update_task_status tool (parallel)
Task T018: delete_task tool (parallel)
Task T019: get_task_statistics tool (parallel)

# All 5 tools can be implemented simultaneously if using different developers
# or AI coding assistants in parallel mode
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Natural Language Task Creation)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Conversational Task Retrieval)
5. Complete Phase 8: Frontend ChatKit UI
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test end-to-end (create tasks, view tasks via chat)
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Users can create and view tasks through natural language chat interface

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → (Can demo task creation via chat)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → (Can demo full CRUD read via chat) ✅ **MVP READY**
4. Add Frontend → Test UI → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → (Task updates via chat)
6. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → (Task deletion via chat)
7. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → (Analytics via chat) ✅ **FULL FEATURE COMPLETE**
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: Frontend (can start earlier, tests with mock data)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. One developer handles Polish phase after all stories done

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent functions, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are OPTIONAL - not included because not requested in specification
- Commit after each completed user story (checkpoint)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Foundational phase is critical - test thoroughly before proceeding to user stories
- Frontend can start after Foundational, but benefits from having backend user stories to test against

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 94
**Setup Phase**: 5 tasks
**Foundational Phase**: 31 tasks (BLOCKING - must complete first)
**User Story 1 (P1)**: 7 tasks
**User Story 2 (P1)**: 7 tasks
**User Story 3 (P2)**: 7 tasks
**User Story 4 (P3)**: 7 tasks
**User Story 5 (P3)**: 7 tasks
**Frontend Phase**: 12 tasks
**Polish Phase**: 11 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 15 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Phase 8 (first 50 tasks + frontend) = ~62 tasks for MVP

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- US1: Send "Add a task to buy groceries" → Verify task in database
- US2: Send "What's pending?" → Verify task list returned
- US3: Send "Mark buy groceries as done" → Verify status updated in database
- US4: Send "Delete buy groceries" → Verify task removed from database
- US5: Send "How am I doing?" → Verify statistics calculation correct

**Suggested Implementation Order**: Setup → Foundational → US1 → US2 → Frontend → US3 → US4 → US5 → Polish
