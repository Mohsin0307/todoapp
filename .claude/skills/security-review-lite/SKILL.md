description: Perform a lightweight security review to catch obvious vulnerabilities and bad practices.
version: 1.0

## When to Use
- After code is generated by /sp.implement
- Before deployment or public exposure
- When reviewing authentication, input handling, or APIs
- For quick sanity checks (not full pentesting)

## Procedure
1. Scan code for obvious security issues:
   - Hardcoded secrets
   - Missing input validation
   - Insecure auth flows
2. Check API endpoints for:
   - Missing authentication
   - Overly permissive access
3. Review data handling:
   - SQL injection risks
   - Improper error messages
4. Highlight risks with short explanations
5. Suggest minimal fixes only

## Output Format
- Issue Title
- Risk Level (Low / Medium / High)
- Description
- Recommended Fix (brief)

## Constraints
- Do NOT perform deep penetration testing
- Do NOT suggest enterprise-level tooling
- Keep feedback concise and actionable
